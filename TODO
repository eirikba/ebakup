backupoperation.BackupSource.iterate_source_files() should not descend
into subtrees that are completely ignored. (Keep in mind that even if
the directory itself is ignored, there may be elements deeper in the
subtree that are not.)

BackupCollection._make_path_from_content_id() hardcodes the splitting points.

Test: Not created

Each path component (except the last) should have the same length as
all other items in the same directory.

Many "problematic" cases not handled

There are plenty of cases that aren't fully handled. In particular
cases that shouldn't happen when everything is correct. Most of these
can be found by searching for NotTestedError.
