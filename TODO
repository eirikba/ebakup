Handle special files

Symlinks are currently ignored. That's probably not optimal. Maybe
symlinks pointing out of tree should be ignored, while symlinks to
in-tree files (and directories) should be registered as symlinks (with
path)? Or may symlinks out-of-tree should be registered too, but
obviously not in the shadow tree?

Similar for sockets and pipes. Register in database, but don't add to
shadow tree?

What about device files? Should not occur, but could be registered in
the database none the less.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do not descend ignored subdirectories:

Status: FIXED

backupoperation.BackupSource.iterate_source_files() should not descend
into subtrees that are completely ignored. (Keep in mind that even if
the directory itself is ignored, there may be elements deeper in the
subtree that are not.)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

BackupCollection._make_path_from_content_id() hardcodes the splitting points.

Test: Not created

Each path component (except the last) should have the same length as
all other items in the same directory.

Many "problematic" cases not handled

There are plenty of cases that aren't fully handled. In particular
cases that shouldn't happen when everything is correct. Most of these
can be found by searching for NotTestedError.
