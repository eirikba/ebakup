Avoid writing "small" duplicate files to disk needlessly

Status: FIXED (100MiB memory buffer)

Currently the code writes every file to a temporary file before
checking whether the file already exists. I should have a moderately
large buffer (100MiB?) and any file smaller than that should just be
read into that buffer so I can check whether it already exists in the
content store before writing.

Actually, reading twice may be better than writing during the first
read, as the second read is likely to be filled from the OS's disk
cache.

Do not descend ignored subdirectories:

Status: FIXED

backupoperation.BackupSource.iterate_source_files() should not descend
into subtrees that are completely ignored. (Keep in mind that even if
the directory itself is ignored, there may be elements deeper in the
subtree that are not.)
