Handle special files

Status: FIXED (special files are registered with their file type.
    Handling in shadow tree is sub-optimal, but I added another TODO
    for that)

Symlinks are currently ignored. That's probably not optimal. Maybe
symlinks pointing out of tree should be ignored, while symlinks to
in-tree files (and directories) should be registered as symlinks (with
path)? Or maybe symlinks out-of-tree should be registered too, but
obviously not in the shadow tree?

Similar for sockets and pipes. Register in database, but don't add to
shadow tree?

What about device files? Should not occur, but could be registered in
the database none the less.

Avoid writing "small" duplicate files to disk needlessly

Status: FIXED (100MiB memory buffer)

Currently the code writes every file to a temporary file before
checking whether the file already exists. I should have a moderately
large buffer (100MiB?) and any file smaller than that should just be
read into that buffer so I can check whether it already exists in the
content store before writing.

Actually, reading twice may be better than writing during the first
read, as the second read is likely to be filled from the OS's disk
cache.

Do not descend ignored subdirectories:

Status: FIXED

backupoperation.BackupSource.iterate_source_files() should not descend
into subtrees that are completely ignored. (Keep in mind that even if
the directory itself is ignored, there may be elements deeper in the
subtree that are not.)
