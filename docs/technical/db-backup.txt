============================
The backup description files
============================

Each of these files describe the state of the source tree when it was
backed up.

The files live in directories named after the year in which the backup
started. And the files themselves are named after the time (to the
precision of minutes) when the backup started without the year.

Example: A backup that started on April 1, 2015 at 12:45:53 would have
one of these files in a directory called "2015". The file itself would
be called "04-01T12:45".

This means that two backups can not start in the same minute. In
practice I doubt this will be a problem.

These files are immutable after being created. So there is no need to
take any locks to read these files.

The backup description files follow the "common format" described in
db-common.txt.


Settings block
==============

<magic> = "ebakup backup data"

Required settings:

 "start": The time when the backup was started
     (e.g. "2015-04-01T12:45:53")

 "end": The time when the backup was completed
     (e.g. "2015-04-01T13:12:50")

If an unknown setting is encountered, chances are that the file format
has changed. So in that case, it is probably best to give up.


Data stored in the file
=======================

In this file is stored information about every file that is backed up
during a single backup run:

- The path at which the file existed
- The content id of a copy of the content
- The size of the file
- The last-modified time stamp of the original file

The content id refers to the content in the content storage, and also
doubles as the checksum of the file's content (due to the way content
ids are created).


Directories
===========

<dataentry> = 0x90 <dirid> <dirparent> <namelength> <dirname>

<dirid>, <dirparent> = continued high bit octet sequence
<namelength> = continued high bit little endian unsigned integer
<dirname> = <namelength> octets

<dirid> values 0-7 are reserved.

These entries describe the tree of directories where the files
live. <dirparent> is the <dirid> of the parent directory, with 0 being
the unnamed "root" directory. <dirname> gives the name of the
directory itself. Systems where file names are strings should encode
the file name using utf-8.


Files
=====

<dataentry> =
    0x91 <dirparent> <namelength> <filename>
    <cidlength> <contentid> <size> <mtime>

<dirparent> = continued high bit octet sequence
<namelength>, <cidlength> =
    continued high bit little endian unsigned integer
<filename> = <namelength> octets
<contentid> = <cidlength> octets
<size> = continued high bit little endian unsigned integer
<mtime> = <year> <second> <nanosecond>

Each of these entries describe one file that was backed
up. <dirparent> indicates which directory the file lives in, again
with 0 being the unnamed "root" directory. <filename> gives the name
of the file. Systems where file names are strings should encode the
file name using utf-8.

<contentid> refers to the content of the file in the content
storage. Also, due to the way content ids are constructed, it doubles
as a checksum of the file's content.

<mtime> consists of a year, a second-of-the-year part and a nanosecond
part. The <second> value assumes that all minutes have 60 seconds, all
hours have 60 minutes, and all days have 24 hours and all non-leap
years have 365 days, and all leap years have 366 days. Leap years are
those where <year> is divisible by 4, except when <year> is divisible
by 100, but again when <year> is divisible by 400. So a leap year has
exactly 31622400 seconds, and a non-leap year exactly 31536000
seconds.

Turning second-of-year into a month, day, hour, minute and second
structure should then be obvious.

<nanosecond> is just a value in the range 0-999999999, giving the
nanosecond part of the time stamp.

<year>, <second> and <nanosecond> together make up 9 octets. The
first 2 octets make up the year as a little-endian unsigned integer
(1-65535). the next 3 octets and the high bit of the sixth octet is a
little-endian unsigned integer giving the second of the year. And the
low 6 bits of the sixth octet and the last 3 octets is a little-endian
unsigned integer giving the nanosecond. Any time that is
unrepresentable or unknown or otherwise problematic should have all 9
octets 0. The year can not be 0 except for this particular case.

This should mean that time stamps are limited to be somewhere in the
years from 1 to 65535, which should be sufficient for my limited use.

When writing these values it is important to use the correct
<mtime>. If there is doubt as to what the correct <mtime> value is for
the data that was actually backed up, store 0.


Making changes
==============

These files are immutable once created. When creating a file:

- Create the yearly directory (if needed)
- Create the file with a ".new" suffix
- Lock whole file for writing
- Check file is empty
- Check that the final file does not exist
- Write initial settings block
- Unlock file
- Write the data to the new file
- Make sure all data is flushed to the OS
- rename ".new" to the real name

The locking and writing of the initial settings block is to protect
against having two processes writing the same file in parallel. If the
.new file already exists (or is not empty after you obtain the lock),
assume that something else is making a backup and give up.

"Write initial settings block" can obviously not fill in the "end"
setting. That will have to be added after the backup is complete.
