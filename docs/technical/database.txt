Backup database
===============

The backup database stores all the information about the backup except
for the actual contents of the files themselves. The content of each
file is stored in the "content storage" (see backup_collection.txt).

The backup database is stored in the "db" top-level directory in the
database collection. In this directory there are:

- "main": This provides global information about the database. It must
  always be present.

- "content": This provides information about the items in the content
  storage. Realistically, this should always be present.

- <YYYY/MM-DDThh:mm>: These files provide information about each
  backup in the backup collection.

More files may be added in future revisions of this document.


Common file format
==================

All the files in the database follow a common file format. See
db-common.txt for a description of this format.


Locks
=====

To safely read and write any of the files in the database, take out
locks. Always take a read lock on any part of any file that you want
to make sure doesn't change, and definitely take a write lock on any
part of any file you want to change.

The lock should be an "fcntl" lock. In python, use fcntl.lockf().

If you need to hold more than a single lock at a time, you MUST take a
lock on the whole of "main" before taking any other lock and you MUST
drop all other locks before dropping the one on "main". Otherwise you
risk deadlocks. (The lock on "main" should be a write lock if any of
the other locks is a write lock. Do NOT upgrade the lock on "main"
from a read lock to a write lock. Downgrading, however, is safe.)

Keep in mind that some files may be modified by being replaced
wholesale. Thus, after obtaining a lock on a file, you MUST check that
the file you have a lock on is the current version of the file and not
an old, obsolete one.


The "main" file
===============

There MUST be a file called "main" in the backup database
directory. This file MUST start with "ebakup database v1" followed by
an LF. If this is not found, the directory is not a backup database.

The "main" file indicates that the directory is a backup database and
also provides general information about the database. The file format
follows the "common format" described in db-common.txt with:

   <magic> = "ebakup database v1"

This identifies the whole directory as being a backup database
following this specification. The file only has a settings block. The
currently defined settings are:

  "checksum": The checksum algorithm used everywhere (unless otherwise
      given). Default: "sha256".


The "content" file
==================

The "content" file holds data about the items in the content
storage. In particular, what checksum each item should have and when
it was last checked.

The file format follows the "common format" described in db-common.txt.

   <magic> = "ebakup content data"

See db-content.txt for details.


The backup description files
============================

The files in the numbered directories describe each individual
backup. The directories are named after the year in which the backup
started.

The file format follows the "common format" described in db-common.txt.

   <magic> = "ebakup backup data"

See db-backup.txt for details.


The verification tracking files
===============================

The "lastcheck" file tracks the time when each piece of information
in the backup storage was last checked for errors.

The "issues" file tracks all potential problems and fixes that have
been noticed.

See db-verify.txt for details.
