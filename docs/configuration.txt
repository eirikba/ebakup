====================
Ebakup configuration
====================

The configuration of ebakup is in one or more files. By default it is
found in the "standard" locations, /etc/ebakup and
~/.config/ebakup/config.

The configuration file is a simple text file, example:

--- config -------------------------------------------------
backup mystuff
  source local:/home/me
    path mine
      static
  collection local:/backup-1/backup
------------------------------------------------------------

The configuration is divided into sections and subsections etc.,
depending on the indentation level. So in the above example, there is
one section on the top level "backup mystuff". This section has two
subsections, one "source" section and one "collection" section. The
"source" section further contains a "path" section that again contains
a "static" section.


Section summary
===============

The possible sections in the configuration files are:

backup <name> - Describes the backup named <name>. Which files to back
    up. Where to store the backup. Etc.
  parent: -
  children: source collection

source <full-path> - Describes sources to be backed up.
  parent: backup
  children: path*

collection <full-path> - Describes a place to store backups.
  parent: backup
  children: -

targetpath <relpath> - Describes where the source files shall be
    copied to within the backup.
  parent: source
  children: -

path <relpath>
paths <relpaths...>
path-glob <glob>
path-globs <globs...>
    Partitions out a sub-tree, typically of the "source" tree.
  parent: source path*
  children: path* ignore dynamic static

ignore - The sub-tree shall be ignored and not be backed up.
  parent: source path*
  children: -

static - The sub-tree shall be backed up, and the files are expected
    never to change. If a backup operation discovers that any of these
    files have changed or disappeared, a warning is raised.
  parent: source path*
  children: -

dynamic - The sub-tree shall be backed up.
  parent: source path*
  children: -


Section: backup
===============

  backup <name>

  parent: -
  children: source collection

This section describes everything about a backup. It describes which
files should be backed up, how they should be organized, how they
should be treated and where they should be backed up to.


Section: source
===============

  source <full-path>

  parent: backup
  children: path*

This section describes the files that should be backed up.


Section: collection
===================

  collection <full-path>

  parent: backup
  children: -

This section describes a directory to store backed up data into.


Section: targetpath
===================

  targetpath <relpath>

  parent: source
  children: -

This section describes the mapping between source paths and backed up
paths. The <full-path> of the "source" section is mapped to the
<relpath> of the targetpath section, relative to the root of the
back-up tree. By default the targetpath is empty.


Section: path*
==============

  path <relpath>
  paths <relpaths...>
  path-glob <glob>
  path-globs <globs...>

  parent: source path*
  children: path* ignore dynamic static

These sections apply their content to a part of the tree(s)
established by the parent section.

All the different forms provide one or more paths relative to the
parent section.

<relpath> is a simple relative path, while <relpaths...> are one or
more <relpath> elements separated by spaces. This means that none of
the paths of "paths" can contain spaces while the single path of
"path" can.

<glob> is a glob and the section applies to all paths that matches
that glob relative to the parent section. Similar to the
"path"/"paths" difference, <globs...> are one or more globs separated
by spaces (and so each one can not contain spaces).

The globs support the following special patterns:

  "*" : Matches zero or more characters, which can be anything.
  "?" : Matches exactly one character, which can be anything.
  "[<chars>]" : Matches exactly one character that must be one of the
      characters in <chars>. (But see below)
  "[!<chars>]" : Matches exactly one character that must be one of the
      characters NOT in <chars>. (But see below)

For the character class matchers ([<chars>] and [!<chars>]) there are
some special behaviours. The character "-" represents every character
"between" the characters on either side of it. This only works for
characters that are part of some well-defined sequence. There are
currently only three such sequences defined: 0 through 9, a through z
and A through Z. In order to match either "-" or "]", they must occur
first in <chars>. If both are to be matched, "]" must come before "-".


Section: ignore
===============

  ignore

  parent: source path*
  children: -

The source files described by the parent section shall be ignored and
not backed up.


Section: static
===============

  static

  parent: source path*
  children: -

The source files described by the parent section shall be backed
up. Furthermore, these files are expected to never change. So if they
change or disappear, a warning should be raised.


Section: dynamic
================

  dynamic

  parent: source path*
  children: -

The source files described by the parent section shall be backed
up. This is the default.
